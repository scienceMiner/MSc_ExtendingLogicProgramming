## Extending Logic Programming

### Abstract

Negation cannot effortlessly be implemented in logic programming. The negation as failure rule has become the accepted model. This project compares and contrasts various possible implementations of negation theories, presents an implementation of a transformer of programs to their finite failure counterparts together with techniques (a constraints meta-interpreter, extending SLDNF) for dealing with universal conditions that arise from transformation. Induction is also considered as an option for the last technique. The report concludes that negation as failure will remain the standard until efficiency is greatly improved in other methods.
